If you want a sample web application that simulates voting during elections, THIS IS IT. 

Zero Security functionality, but uses old election data. Created in college way back when ^_^

Feel free to download, and spin up in your personal lab environment. My personal favorite,  Kali Linux. 

Use Read Me file. With Kali linux, it comes with community version of burp, owasp zap and so much more (6k+ free tool) that can be used for application security testing.
